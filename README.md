# Sorting Algorithms  ðŸ“Š
---

This project provides an example of the implementation of sorting algorithms in Java with a step-by-step description of execution and analysis of the efficiency of the algorithm under various conditions.
In order to display the results, `Tomcat`, `Servlets`, and `JSP` technologies are utilized in this context.
##  Selection Sort
---

Selection Sort is a sorting technique that sequentially arranges an array by repeatedly selecting the smallest or largest element and placing it in its correct position. It involves multiple iterations to accomplish the sorting. However, its time complexity is higher compared to insertion sort. Selection Sort is not efficient for large datasets due to its time complexity.

### ðŸ§¾ Step-by-step explanation
- Find the Smallest: Start by finding the smallest element in the array.
- Swap with First: Swap this smallest element with the first element in the array.
- Move to Next Unsorted: Move to the next unsorted element.
- Repeat Steps 1-3: Repeat steps 1 to 3 for the remaining unsorted elements.
- Array is Sorted: Once all elements are sorted, the array is in order.

Efficient Use Cases:
- Small Datasets: Selection sort can be efficient for small datasets where its simplicity outweighs its inefficiency.

- Nearly Sorted Data: If the data is almost sorted or the number of inversions is small, selection sort can perform reasonably well.

- Memory Constraints: When memory usage needs to be minimized, selection sort's in-place sorting can be beneficial.

Inefficient Use Cases:
- Large Datasets: Selection sort becomes highly inefficient as the dataset grows, so it's not suitable for large arrays or lists.

- Real-Time Systems: In real-time systems where speed is critical, selection sort's time complexity makes it unsuitable.

- Performance Optimization Required: If the goal is to achieve the best sorting performance, more efficient algorithms like quick sort or merge sort should be chosen over selection sort.
